Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program(s) is to understand how the picturelab works. We analyze code and try to understand how we can create images. 
We also study code and modify it to print values within a given matrix, using previous concepts learned.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled to understand how the picturelab worked and how I could gain values from within a matrix. 
They were a bit difficult to understand at first. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working with images and trying to attain values from within a given matrix. I will be sure to revisit these concepts!
