Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to utilize concepts taught in module 7 and part of module 8: 
binary and sequential search to a challenge program. We are to create a contact list array of 10 objects, 
storing values such as name, relationship, birthday, phone number, and email.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled to understand how these concepts can be put together in one large program. 
This program had several parts and I needed to write the pseudocode.  

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working on a challenge program that covered concepts in both module 7 and module 8. 
I will be sure to revisit these concepts in the future.
