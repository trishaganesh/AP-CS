-------------------------------PMR----------------------------------------
<+s>: In this program, I understood how to use replace when replacing numbers with special characters. 
However, it was still unclear and I will need more practice. 

<-s>: With practice, I will be able to fully understand how to work this program. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding this info will help me in the future. 



I learned how to display the first letter of the user's first name using the material taught in class. 
I could improve a bit so I can do better in the future.
