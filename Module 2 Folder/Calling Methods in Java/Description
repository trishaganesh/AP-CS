PROJECT TITLE: 02.09 Calling Methods in Java

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of the project is to call methods already provided to perform calculations. 

VERSION or DATE: 2/04/2021

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: We must call the above methods already provided for us.

For example, 

public static void addTheseTwo(){    System.out.println("Ten plus five equals " + (10 + 5));}   
is set to print the following: Ten plus five equals 15. 

However, in order for this to happen we must "call" it by calling "addTheTwo" method. 
In this program, we will have to do the same for multiplication and division. 
multiplyTheseTwo and divideTheseTwo will need to be called as well. (Lastly, we need to print the statement as well as the answer) 

AUTHORS: Trisha Ganesh 

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

The project will allow us to write code (essentially 3 blocks of code) which will allow us to call the 3 methods already given to us. 
-------------------------------PMR----------------------------------------
<+s>: This program allowed me to understand the importance of calling methods inside the main method. 
Essentially all the calls performed were inside the main method. 

<-s>: Overall, at first, I called three methods in separate main methods which didn't make sense as there is only supposed to be 1 main method.
All 3 were supposed to be called in the main (1) method. 
 
Overall, this program was a good practice and it definitely helped me understand future concepts.
