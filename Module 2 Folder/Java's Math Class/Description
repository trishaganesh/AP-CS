PROJECT TITLE: 02.03: JAVA'S MATH CLASS

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of the project is to calculate the hypotenuse of two right triangles using the appropriate math class methods. 

VERSION or DATE: October 31, 2020

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: We must start by using Math.random() to randomly generate values between 5-23 to determine the sides of our triangles. 
I casted it to int so the sides are whole numbers. Next, we must use nthPower to determine what power we want to raise our side to. 
I chose 2 since that is the formula to calculate hypotenuse is a2 + b2 = c2. 
Therefore, setting the nthPower = 2 will raise whatever value to the second power. 
Now that we've set what power we want to raise the number to, we must actually raise the power. 
We can use powValue to determine the value after it has been raised. For example, you can use Math.pow to raise the number to a power. 
For example, if my side is 4 and I want to raise it to the 2nd power, then I could do Math.pow(4,2). 
This more efficient than writing 4 * 4. Once you've done all of this, you must do the same for the second side of the triangle. 
Then, the same for the second triangle. One thing to take away from this is you must use Math.random() to randomly generate values for your sides, 
nthPower to set a power for your valye, and lastly, Math.pow to raise the value to that power. 
Finally, once you have added both sides of the triangle (with the Math.pow already complete) you must then use Math.sqrt to find the square root of C 
after you added A and B. Once, you've used Math.sqrt to calculate the answer after the square root, this is your hypotenuse. 

Note that you must...

use Math.random to find the "randomly generated" values of your triangle sides. 

use nthPower to set a power for your sides

use Math.pow to actually calculate the value of the side after the power is set 

and Math.sqrt to find the square root of the answer you got once you do a2 + b2

USER INSTRUCTIONS: This project will calculate the hypotenuse of two right triangles. 
The sides of both triangles are randomly generated using Math.random()
Next, you must raise whatever value for A and B to 2 because you're trying to use the formula a2 + b2 = c2 
(formula for calculating the hypotenuse of a right triangle) and use Math.pow to raise it to the second power. 
You use nthPower to set the power to want to raise the value to but Math.pow is actually raising the value. You need to do this for both sides A and B.
Next, you add the values of A and B to get the value of C. However, you must use Math.sqrt to square root the answer to get the actual value of C. 
Once, you've done this, repeat the same process to find the hypotenuse for the 2nd triangle. 
-------------------------------PMR----------------------------------------
<+s>: This program allowed me to understand the importance of using Math.random(). 
Before, I had no clue how to use Math.random in the program and ended up not including it at all. 
However, with a little patience, I was able to learn what it was used for. 
I was able to use Math.pow and Math.sqrt to better understand how they can be used in a program to find the hypotenuse of a triangle. 
I know that I will be able to use it when working with other formulas such as finding the area of a circle. 

<-s>: Overall, the major mistake I made was not including the Math.random() the first time I wrote this program. 
I was confused at first so I spoke with my teacher and he gave me some helpful tips on how the Math.random() should be used in this program. 
When he said "randomly generated numbers" that's when it hit me! I knew what I should've done and how I should've done it. 
To fix this mistake, I will be sure to reread the directions and ask if there is something confusing that I don't understand. 
I will be sure to fix this in the future. 
 
Overall, this program was good practice for me to practice java but also for me to review old math concepts such as finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle. 
I'd say that I enjoyed writing this program even though it might've been frustrating at first. 

What I learned:

I learned that there's in the random number generator there's an inclusive of 5 and an exclusive of 23 meaning that the highest 
number that will be outputted is 22. What I learned from my mistake is that I needed to set the numbers to 5 and 18 to ensure that
22 will be the highest number that is outputted. (The highest number up till 23 - not including 23. )
