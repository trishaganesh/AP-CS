Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how we can use previously taught concepts to understand the attributes related to a deck of 52 cards.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand how we can represent the different attributes for example, ace of hearts or queen of spades in our program. 
The ArrayList was confusing; however, I revised the concept and was able to understand how to implement that concept to my program. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working with a deck of cards as I like playing cards in general. The idea of utilizing knowledge for a program is enthralling to me!
