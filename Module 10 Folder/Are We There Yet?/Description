Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand the concept of recursion and 
how we can utilize previous java concepts such as prompting the user, using if statements, 
and while statements to keep our program up-to-date, as well as error checking. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled with error checking and how I could prompt the user each time a value was entered. 
In addition, the recursion concept needed to be revised. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed learning about the Fibonacci sequence as well as learning about recursion as I like working with numbers.
I will be sure to revisit this program in the future.
