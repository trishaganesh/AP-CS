Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how to use merge sort as well as revisiting previous 
concepts such as insertion and selection sorting.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled with understand merge sort and what it entailed. 
Merge sort is similar to selection, insertion, and binary sort, except we are merging various elements within an array in sorted order. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working with 10 product objects within the ArrayList as it was a very fun exercise. 
This program allowed me to think carefully, allowing me to revisit previous concepts taught in the course.
