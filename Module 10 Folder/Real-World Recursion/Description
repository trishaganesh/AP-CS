Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how recursion works and why they are important. 
This project is the first of module 10 and recursion is sure to revisit us going forward. 
Therefore, it is important to understand the concept of recursion.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I found it difficult to understand what recursion was and how we could use code to create a shape, 
divided into multiple uneven shapes which are colored. However, I slowly began to realize that the idea of classes, methods, and Arraylist, which were previously taught concepts. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working with images and shapes. This project reminded me of the past assignments 
where we needed to work to modify images. Now, we were able to create our own using code!
