Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand class hierarchies and how they were used in this program.
We have several subclasses that inherit from the other superclasses. The extend keyword is useful when trying to accomplish this.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled to understand how we can use the "extends" keyword and how it was used to help a subclass "inherit" 
characteristics from its superclass. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed understanding how inheritance works and how we could use the extends keyword. 
Also, the relationship between subclasses and superclasses was an important concept I needed to learn.
