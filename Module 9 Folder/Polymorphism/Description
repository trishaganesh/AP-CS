Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how polymorphism works. For this program, we needed to utilize a static method: ShowCenter, 
code in the main method, and a for loop or for each loop, looping through each item in the ArrayList. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled to understand how I could use the ShowCenter method and how I could present all values within the ArrayList 
without having to individually write code for each of them, making the code longer and harder to understand. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed understanding how polymorphism works and how this concept is important to understand. 
I was also able to utilize my knowledge of ArrayLists and for each loops to get the program running.
