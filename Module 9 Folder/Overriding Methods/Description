Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how overriding methods in java works. 
For this program, we needed to utilize a static method: showEffectBoth, add code in the main method, 
and a for loop or for each loop, looping through each item, similarly to the previous program, in order to attain values.

Area for improvement: 

Initially, I struggled to understand how I could test for equality. Using if-statements seemed like the most viable option. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed learning more about java, the concept of overriding methods. It is a very important concept that I was able to use for this program. 
I hope to brush up my skills and learn more concepts going forward.
