Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how we can use Arrays or ArrayLists to put together concepts learned earlier in this module. 

Concepts such as traversals, replacement methods, insertion methods, and deletion methods were taught and used for this program.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand how I could utilize 5 objects in my ArrayList while giving each student object a set of 5 grades. 
That required a lot of thinking and understanding to solve. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed utilizing concepts taught previously in the module to one large challenge program. This prompted me to think better and more carefully.
