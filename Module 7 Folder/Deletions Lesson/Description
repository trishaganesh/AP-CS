Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how we could utilize Arrays and ArrayLists to learn concepts such as 
insertion and deletion of values within an array. 

We needed to understand how insertion and deletion methods work. 

This program allowed us to challenge ourselves by learning unfamiliar concepts.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand how insertion methods worked and what they entailed. However, the 
lesson was very helpful in helping me understand how insertion methods work in both arrays and arraylists. 

What I liked: 

I liked learning about insertion and deletion methods as they were very useful in a program such as this.
