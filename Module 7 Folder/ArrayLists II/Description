Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to print the results for ingredients/data for 6 different cheesecakes by using concepts such as ArrayList, 
printf to format output, toString(), getters, and more. 

We will need to understand ArrayLists for this project. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Area for improvement: 

I struggled to understand how ArrayLists worked and how they were different from writing regular Arrays. I needed to understand the purpose 
of an ArrayList as well as how it could be used in this program. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed calculating the values for 6 different cheesecakes as well as using concepts learned in module 6.
