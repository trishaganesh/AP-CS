Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

The purpose of this program is to understand how we could utilize for loops, for each loops, arrays and ArrayLists in our program. 

We will need to understand ArrayLists and how to use for each loops/ for loops/ if statements for this project. 

This challenge program was a good practice as it allowed us to use all topics learned to challenge ourselves.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand how to print values based on the range of years the user entered. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working with this program and understanding how I can use topics learned in the past and put them all together in a single project.
