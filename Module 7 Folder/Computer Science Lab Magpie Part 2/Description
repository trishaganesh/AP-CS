Student Name: Trisha Ganesh

Purpose of program: 

This purpose of this program is to understand how Magpie works, while understanding the importance of a human to chatbot interaction.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand how to update Magpie and make changes for Magpie to understand how to distinguish between several phrases. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed working with the Magpie lab again as it is a very useful tool to utilize java concepts for a unique program such as the Magpie program.
